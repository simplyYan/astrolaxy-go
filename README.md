# Astrolaxy
A Go library for astronomy, physics and mathematics

## Key features
- Lightweight, fast and simple: astrolaxy is extremely fast and lightweight, and was built only with built-in libraries. The Go language is much faster than Python, and just as easy, and using astrolaxy, calculations in physics, astronomy, mathematics, and science in general are perfect;

- Efficient and precise: All formulas are original and tested, they are perfect;

- More than 90 formulas: It's a big toolbox! It has everything you need;

- Open-source: Anyone can use and modify astrolaxy, it's open-source;

## How to install
You can install it with `go get`, see:
```bash
go get -u github.com/simplyYan/astrolaxy-go
```

## Docs
The library is very simple to use and you can access the documentation via pkg.dev:
```bash
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/simplyYan/astrolaxy-go
```
